## Lamport's Bakery-Algorithm

### Implementation of the Bakery algorithm in C programming language. The B.A. is one of the simplest known solutions to the mutual exclusion problem for the general case of N process. Bakery Algorithm is a critical section solution for N processes. The algorithm preserves the first come first serve property.
